This project uses data from the [TalkingData Mobile User Demographics](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics) Kaggle 
competition. 

TalkingData is a Chinese based mobile data platform. From the competition site:

>In this competition, Kagglers are challenged to build a model predicting users’ 
>demographic characteristics based on their app usage, geolocation, and mobile 
>device properties. Doing so will help millions of developers and brand 
>advertisers around the world pursue data-driven marketing efforts which are 
>relevant to their users and catered to their preferences.

# The Data

The data for the competition can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics/data .

I have downloaded and read each file into R, giving each `data.frame` the same 
name as the file. Below are the first 3 records of each file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
load("data/data.rda")
```

```{r}
head(app_events, 3)
head(app_labels, 3)
head(events, 3)
head(gender_age_test, 3)
head(gender_age_train, 3)
head(phone_brand_device_model, 3) # Chinese characters displayed in UTF-8 codes
```

<br><br>

The number of records in each `data.frame` can be seen in the table below.

<br><br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(printr)
table_dimensions
```

<br><br>

And below is the data schema provided on the Kaggle site.

# Tidy Data

For our purpose, it is more convenient to look at the data in one nice "tidy" table. I have joined the tables and created some new columns that help make 
sense of the data. You can see the data by clicking on "Data Table" in the 
banner above. Below is a data dictionary.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
read.csv("data/dictionary.csv")
```

# Data Exploration

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(dplyr)
load("data/prepped_data.rda")
ggpairs(
  select(full_data, age, gender),
  mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = gender),
  title = "Demographics"
)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
d <- full_data %>%
  group_by(gender, phone_brand) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
ggplot(d, aes(phone_brand, count, fill = phone_brand)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      facet_grid(gender ~ .) +
      theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90),
            axis.title.x=element_blank()) 
```
