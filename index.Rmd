This project uses data from the [TalkingData Mobile User Demographics](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics) Kaggle 
competition. 

TalkingData is a Chinese based mobile data platform. From the competition site:

>In this competition, Kagglers are challenged to build a model predicting usersâ€™ 
>demographic characteristics based on their app usage, geolocation, and mobile 
>device properties. Doing so will help millions of developers and brand 
>advertisers around the world pursue data-driven marketing efforts which are 
>relevant to their users and catered to their preferences.

# The Data

The data for the competition can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics/data .

I have downloaded and read each file into R, giving each `data.frame` the same 
name as the file. Below are the first 3 records of each file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
load("data/data.rda")
```

```{r}
head(app_events, 3)
head(app_labels, 3)
head(events, 3)
head(gender_age_test, 3)
head(gender_age_train, 3)
head(phone_brand_device_model, 3) # Chinese characters displayed in UTF-8 codes
```

<br><br>

The number of records in each `data.frame` can be seen in the table below.

<br><br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(printr)
table_dimensions
```

<br><br>

And below is the data schema provided on the Kaggle site.

# Tidy Data

For our purpose, it is more convenient to look at the data in one nice "tidy"
table.
