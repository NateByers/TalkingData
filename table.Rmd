Below is the data set described in the "Tidy Data" section of the documenation. 
See the `stage_data.R` script in the 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/NateByers/TalkingData) for the R code
that created this table. The table contains a random sample of 1,000 records 
from a table with 192,001 records.

__Note__: The Chinese characters that represent phone brand  and device model 
are sometimes rendered in their UTF-8 code and sometimes not at all.

```{r, chache=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
load("data/prepped_data.rda")
d <- full_data[sample(row.names(full_data), 1000), ] %>%
  select(event_id, device_id, longitude:age, phone_brand:Other)
  
library(DT)
DT::datatable(d, rownames = FALSE)
```
